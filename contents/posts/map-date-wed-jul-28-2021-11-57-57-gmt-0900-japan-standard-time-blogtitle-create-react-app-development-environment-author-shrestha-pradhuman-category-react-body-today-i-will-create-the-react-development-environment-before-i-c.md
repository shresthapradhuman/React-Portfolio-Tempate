Today I will create the React Development Environment. Before I create the project let me tell you a little about React.\
\
**What is React?**

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to build single-page applications.  React also allow us to create reusable UI components. for more information visit [React](https://www.blogger.com/u/2/blog/post/edit/8786400733664376562/1594740828631468891#) official website.\
\
Now I will build React development environment.

### Requirement:

The latest version of Nodejs, npm, or yarn should be preinstalled.

Go to the terminal and create the project folder.

$ mkdir project

Now create the React app using the following command.

$ cd project

$ npx create-react-app app-name

After waiting for few seconds  React development environment is ready. Then inside the app root folder run command.

$ cd app-name

$ npm start or yarn start

Let's check is it working or not. In the browser address bar type http://localhost:3000/. If It displays like this then It's ready to work on it.
