Before I create the project let me tell you a little about React.\n\n### What is React?\n\nReact is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to build single-page applications.  React also allow us to create reusable UI components. for more information visit [React](https://reactjs.org/) official website.\n\nNow I will build React development environment.\n\n### Requirement:\n\nThe latest version of Nodejs, npm, or yarn should be preinstalled.\n\nGo to the terminal and create the project folder.\n\n```\n$ mkdir project\n```\n\nNow create the React app using the following command.\n\n```\n$ cd project\n$ npx create-react-app app-name\n```\n\nAfter waiting for few seconds  React development environment is ready. Then inside the app root folder run command.\n\n```\n$ cd app-name\n$ npm start or yarn start\n```\n\nLet's check is it working or not. In the browser address bar type http://localhost:3000/. If It displays like this then It's ready to work on it.\n\n![react-starter-page](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sKKvaZku2Qc/YPGdJi6VQOI/AAAAAAAAAAM/okcmAskqucsMPXOGcGMvAFrbVXDT7fgGQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/react-success-screen%2B%25281%2529.png \"react-starter-page\")"}]
